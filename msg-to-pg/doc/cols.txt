2. Quick docs: SMS vs MMS columns
SMS (from sms_raw → sms_parsed-style view)

Typical columns we’ve been using / talking about:

id – internal row id (not from XML).

file_name – backup file basename.

idx_in_file – 0-based or 1-based index in that XML.

source_id – original _id or similar from the phone DB.

date_ms – parsed->>'date' (ms since epoch).

date_sent_ms – parsed->>'date_sent' (ms since epoch, or 0/empty).

readable_date – literal parsed->>'readable_date' from the XML.

msg_box – cast of parsed->>'type':

1 = inbox (incoming)

2 = sent (outgoing)

others are drafts/outbox/etc.

address – parsed->>'address' (other party’s number, or service).

body – parsed->>'body' (SMS text).

Flags/emetics:

read, seen, locked, protocol, status, sub_id, etc.

All of those XML-ish ones are directly from the <sms ...> attributes.

MMS (from mms_raw)

MMS is structurally similar at the top, but text is buried:

Top-level parsed keys (simplified):

date, date_sent – like SMS, ms since epoch.

msg_box or m_type / box – indicates inbox vs sent.

read, seen, sub_id, etc.

thread_id or similar conversation id.

parts – child JSON structure:
parsed->'parts'->'part' is an array of objects like:

ct – content type, e.g. text/plain or image/jpeg.

text – text content for ct='text/plain'.

name, cid, cl – media identifiers, filenames, etc.

addrs – addresses (from/to), often in:

parsed->'addrs'->'addr' array with:

address

type (from, to, etc.)

So:

Yes, everything we’ll touch in parsed is from the original XML.

The only “made up” bits are:

date_ms/date_sent_ms = numeric versions.

peer = your chosen “other side” per message.

in = boolean derived from the box/type.
